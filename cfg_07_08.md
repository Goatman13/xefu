## Overview
Configs 07 and 08 are responsible for patching x86 code at runtime. The emulator uses this to fix some issues, but community may know this kind of patching from widescreen patches, etc.

## Cfg7
No less, no more; cfg7 is just count of cfg8 config sets. Single set is 3 x 4 bytes of data.

## Cfg8
This config contains Original Xbox memory patch description. It seems that only code patching is available, but data patch is untested. Value is a memory address to config data sets.

Config data is 3 x 4 bytes and fields are:
1. Address to be patched
2. Patch size (1/2/4 supported)
3. Patch hex

Since patch hex is always 4 bytes we need to fill upper bytes with 00. For example, if we want to patch single byte at address 0x12345 to 0xC3, patch size will be 0x00000001 and patch hex will be 0x000000C3.

## More Info
In the example below, you can see what the official patch for Kung Fu Chaos does. Pictures describe the first half of the patch only, the second part does exactly the same thing, just on different address.

```
   CONFIG 7/8 data:
    patch count: 0x00000004
    patch XBE addr: 0x0015DF0F | patch size: 1 byte(s) | patch hex: 0xFF <---
    patch XBE addr: 0x0015DF17 | patch size: 1 byte(s) | patch hex: 0x8D <---
    patch XBE addr: 0x0015DF69 | patch size: 1 byte(s) | patch hex: 0xFF
    patch XBE addr: 0x0015DF71 | patch size: 1 byte(s) | patch hex: 0x8C
```

As you can see, by editing two bytes the patch redirects the call to a different function and adjusts the agrument to be passed to the stack instead of in esi, because that's how newly pointed functions take args.
